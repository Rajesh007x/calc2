                    <p>
                        The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before.
                        The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this
                        unprecedented integration of capabilities.
                        The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information
                        dissemination,
                        and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without
                        regard for geographic location Computer scientists Vinton Cerf
                        and Bob Kahn invented the Internet Communication protocol referred as ‘Internet’.

                            The idea behind internet was first started by

                        <li>
                            The idea was that set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and
                            programs from any site.

                            Licklider was the first head of the computer research program at DARPA,4 starting in October
                            1962.

                    <h4>Computer in early Period:</h4>

                    <p>In early period computer was large and expensive and standalone. The computers were never
                        communicating and it was difficult to communicate with one computer to another.
                        Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications network in which two network
                        nodes establish a dedicated communications channel (circuit) through the network before the
                        nodes may communicate.

                    <h5 class="mt-0">Arpanet</h5>
                    <p>In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept and quickly put
                        together his plan for the “ARPANET”, publishing it in 1967.
                        This was done to solve the problem of circuit switching. In circuit switching if the circuit is
                        cut the message is lost so inorder to prevent it from happening the new idea packet switching
                        was discovered.
                        In 1969, the idea became a modest reality with the interconnection of four university computers.
                        The initial purpose was to communicate with and share computer resources among mainly scientific
                        users at the connected institutions.
                        ARPANET took advantage of the new idea of sending information in small units called packets that
                        could be routed on different paths and reconstructed at their destination.</p>
