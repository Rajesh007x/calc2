                Xerox Corporation assembles a team of world-class experts in information and physical sciences to become

                ‘The Architects of Information.’ The company establishes the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (Xerox
                PARC) under the direction of
                Dr. George Pake. The charter for Xerox PARC is to create ‘The Office of the Future. ‘Pala-Alto Research
                Centre was the one
                which came up with mouse, keyboard, GUI etc.

                Steve jobs grew up in Pala-Alto. He got a tour and saw the work of which Xerox is doing and he used the
                idea for himself.

                one of the first
                highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.i.e personal computers like desktop and they started
                selling a lot of

                    IBM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    IBM was selling mainframe computers at the time and the Apple II personal computers were selling
                    more.
                    IBM realized that personal computer is fast compared to mainframe computers and in order to nullify
                    the dominance
                    of Apple II share IBM thought that they should produce personal computers. IBM formed a team and
                    they had a
                    proposal. They decided they cannot manufacture their own devices instead they though to use generic
                    PC,
                    microprocessors etc in order to catch Apple in business. They developed a Bios which bridges the
                    hardware and
                    software. But the issue is they did not have a proper operating system. IBM sent a team to Gary
                    kildall.
